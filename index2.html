          <h3>Information</h3>
          <p>Pat from Seattle combined two signature Seattle icons, salmon and coffee to create
             coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies! The cookies are made into the shape of a salmon, and are actually made with salmon.
             They are the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a PNW morning. Or PNW afternoon... whatever.</p>
